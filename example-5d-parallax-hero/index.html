        <h2>Mountains</h2>
        <p>Mountains are majestic and beautiful natural features that attract many people who love adventure, scenery,
            and wildlife. However, mountains also pose many dangers to those who visit them, especially if they are not
            prepared or experienced enough. Some of the common dangers of mountains are:

            Altitude sickness: This is a condition that occurs when the body does not get enough oxygen due to the low
            air pressure and oxygen levels at high altitudes. Altitude sickness can cause symptoms such as headache,
            nausea, dizziness, fatigue, shortness of breath, and loss of appetite. In severe cases, it can lead to
            life-threatening complications such as pulmonary edema (fluid in the lungs) or cerebral edema (swelling of
            the brain). Altitude sickness can be prevented by acclimatizing gradually to the altitude, staying hydrated,
            avoiding alcohol and tobacco, and taking medication such as acetazolamide or dexamethasone if prescribed by
            a doctor.
            Avalanches: These are sudden and rapid movements of large masses of snow down a slope. Avalanches can be
            triggered by natural factors such as weather, terrain, and snow conditions, or by human factors such as
            skiing, snowboarding, or hiking. Avalanches can bury, injure, or kill people who are caught in their path.
            Avalanches can be avoided by checking the avalanche forecast, choosing a safe route, carrying an avalanche
            beacon, probe, and shovel, and knowing how to rescue someone who is buried.
            Hypothermia: This is a condition that occurs when the body loses more heat than it can produce, resulting in
            a dangerously low body temperature. Hypothermia can cause symptoms such as shivering, confusion, slurred
            speech, drowsiness, and loss of consciousness. In extreme cases, it can lead to death. Hypothermia can be
            prevented by wearing warm and waterproof clothing, eating and drinking enough, avoiding sweating and
            wetness, and seeking shelter if the weather is cold or windy.
            Frostbite: This is a condition that occurs when the skin and underlying tissues freeze due to exposure to
            cold temperatures. Frostbite can affect any part of the body, but especially the extremities such as
            fingers, toes, ears, and nose. Frostbite can cause symptoms such as numbness, tingling, pain, blisters, and
            blackening of the skin. In severe cases, it can lead to permanent damage or amputation. Frostbite can be
            prevented by wearing gloves, socks, hats, and scarves, keeping the skin dry and warm, and avoiding alcohol
            and tobacco.
            Rockfalls: These are sudden and unpredictable movements of rocks or boulders down a slope. Rockfalls can be
            caused by natural factors such as erosion, weathering, earthquakes, or volcanic activity, or by human
            factors such as blasting, mining, or construction. Rockfalls can hit, injure, or kill people who are near
            them. Rockfalls can be avoided by staying away from unstable slopes or cliffs, wearing a helmet and
            protective clothing, and being alert for signs of rock movement.
            These are some of the dangers of mountains that people should be aware of and prepared for before venturing
            into them. Mountains are not only beautiful but also challenging and risky environments that require respect
            and caution. By following some safety tips and precautions, people can enjoy the mountains without putting
            themselves or others in danger.</p>
